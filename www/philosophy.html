      cmpnnts is built to quickly scaffold websites that load fast anywhere.
      This is achieved by building small, self-contained (no dependency) components that can be
      plugged into any website autonomously. Of course you can also grab all components and build an
      entire site without any additional CSS. At the end of the day, cmpnnts is just CSS/HTML.
    </p>
    <p class="w">
      Every component uses as few selectors as possible, keeping the file-size and
      the amount of class names to learn very small. Cmpnnts also aims to write less, which is why
      class names are super minimal (and thus harder to remember).
    </p>
    <p class="w">
      cmpnnts probably doesn't account for every need you might have while building a site.
      That's also why adding your own CSS or modifying components is encouraged and should be easy to accomplish.
      This is also a reason why cmpnnts doesn't use a pre- or post-processor but standard, minified CSS.
