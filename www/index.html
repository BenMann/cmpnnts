    cmpnnts is a collection of tiny components written to consume as little bandwidth as possible.
    Every component can be used separately and is easy to use and beautiful to look at.
    Predefnied classes make it easy to quickly design and build clean and responsive sites that load fast anywhere.

          Classnames in cmpnnts are equally small as the actual styles they provide.
          If you're looking for descriptive names, modifiers or similar techniques for your classnames, cmpnnts might not be for you.

          Because minimal classnames can be a blessing and a curse at the same time, good documentation is mendatory.
          This in&shy;cludes stats about the size of each component and how to combine them.
